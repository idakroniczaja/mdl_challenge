1. NO PARAMETERS PROVIDED:
   If no parameters are provided (if BY is undefined), data will be sorted by default parameters(by=id, order=asc, max=50) default endpoint https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps

2. BY PARAM IS REQUIRED:
   The previous response will appear until we pass by value of two permitted options 'id' or 'name' for by param, then we will get data sorted by name or by id endpoint https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=name https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=id
   Since by param is required, this is going to be response if we pass other params without by value endpoint https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?start=20 (it won't return array starting with 20 id or index, but default array, because by is required and only values permitted are 'id' and 'name')

3. PAGINATION BY NAME or ID:
   3.1 IF BOTH, START AND END PARAMS ARE PASSED

I sliced sortedByName array defining startIndex as index of element which name is equal to start parameter and endIndex as index of element which name is equal to end parameter + 1(to include that last element) endpoint https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=name&start=my-app-003&end=my-app-010 (This endpoint will return data starting from 3rd element till the 10th, paginating by name)

For pagination by id I used a bit different approach, since ids are numbers. Instead of slicing and using indexes of elements, I used filter() and filter array by ids being less or equal than start param and greater or equal with end values params provided. endpoint https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=id&start=3&end=10

(This endpoint will return data starting from 3rd element till the 10th, paginating by id)

3.2 IF BOTH, START AND END PARAMS ARE OMITTED

If, however, start is omitted, startIndex will be equal to first elements index(which is 0) endpoint https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=id

3.3 IF END IS OMITTED

In this case end is going to be equal to end of data, but it still returns results for max param(if not passed it is 50) endpoint https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=id&start=3
(it returns data starting with 3rd element and default max of 50) https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=id&start=3&max=20 (if max is passed with start, it will return data from start value and only 20 results)

3.4 THE MAX PAGE

Final array is filtered by this param, so it returns this number of results endpoing https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=id&start=3&max=20

In case end extends beyond maximum passed, array will have only 20 elements endpoint https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=id&start=3&end=50&max=20

If start or end values are not passed, the array will have as many elements as we pass in max param, starting with first elem endpoint https://mdliveqa.herokuapp.com/apps?by=id&max=36

3.5 THE ORDER OF DATA

If we want response to be asc or desc order, i sorted filteredArrays dependint on value of order.
